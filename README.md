# DisjunctiveDifferentiableLayers.jl

`DisjunctiveDifferentiableLayers.jl` provides differentiable projection layers for neural networks whose outputs must satisfy mixed logical-linear constraints.

The package lets users define constraints of the form

```text
global linear constraints
+
(disjunct 1 OR disjunct 2 OR ...)
+
(disjunct 1 OR disjunct 2 OR ...)
+ ...
```

and automatically builds a differentiable projection layer that can be placed after a neural network, especially a Flux.jl model.

The intended workflow is:

```text
raw neural prediction
        ↓
differentiable disjunctive projection layer
        ↓
constraint-satisfying prediction
```

The package is designed for research on differentiable constrained learning, neural-symbolic learning, and safe neural network prediction.

## Formulations

The layer supports three lifted convexified formulations.

| Formulation | Description |
|---|---|
| `:dnf` | Full DNF convex-hull formulation. Stronger but can grow combinatorially. |
| `:cnf` | One convex-hull block per disjunction. Scalable but generally weaker. |
| `:partial_dnf` | Expands a chosen subset of rules into DNF and keeps the rest as CNF. |

All three formulations are convexified projection layers. The projected output is guaranteed to satisfy the selected convexified formulation. Depending on the formulation, especially `:cnf` and `:partial_dnf`, the projected output may lie in a relaxation of the original discrete logical set.

---

## Installation

This package currently uses a modified version of `DiffOpt.jl` with a regularized KKT solve for more stable reverse differentiation.

Until the DiffOpt patch is upstreamed, install the modified DiffOpt first:

```julia
using Pkg

Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/ShramanPal/DiffOpt.jl")
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/ShramanPal/DisjunctiveDifferentiableLayers.jl")
```

For local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShramanPal/DisjunctiveDifferentiableLayers.jl
cd DisjunctiveDifferentiableLayers.jl
julia --project=.
```

Then:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.instantiate()
Pkg.test()
```

---

## Basic idea

A neural network produces an unconstrained prediction:

```julia
yhat = backbone(x)
```

The projection layer maps it to a point satisfying the selected convexified rule set:

```julia
y = projection_layer(yhat)
```

The full constrained model is:

```julia
x -> backbone(x) -> disjunctive projection layer -> projected y
```

The projection is differentiable, so training can be performed using ordinary Flux/Zygote code.

---

## A first disjunctive model

Suppose the neural network predicts two outputs:

```text
y[1], y[2]
```

We want:

```text
0 <= y[1] <= 1
0 <= y[2] <= 1

global constraint:
y[1] + y[2] >= 0.8

rule 1:
y[1] <= 0.25 OR y[1] >= 0.75

rule 2:
y[2] <= 0.25 OR y[2] >= 0.75
```

This can be modeled as follows.

```julia
using DisjunctiveDifferentiableLayers

# Create a disjunctive model with two output variables:
# y[1] and y[2].
dm = DisjunctiveModel(2)

# Set box bounds:
# 0 <= y[1] <= 1
# 0 <= y[2] <= 1
set_bounds!(
    dm,
    lower = [0.0, 0.0],
    upper = [1.0, 1.0],
)

# Add a global linear constraint.
# This constraint must hold in the projected output:
# y[1] + y[2] >= 0.8
add_linear_constraint!(dm, [1.0, 1.0], :>=, 0.8)

# Add rule 1:
# y[1] <= 0.25 OR y[1] >= 0.75
#
# The name :x_split is optional, but useful for partial-DNF ordering.
add_disjunction!(
    dm,
    [LinearConstraint([1.0, 0.0], :<=, 0.25)],
    [LinearConstraint([1.0, 0.0], :>=, 0.75)];
    name = :x_split,
)

# Add rule 2:
# y[2] <= 0.25 OR y[2] >= 0.75
#
# The name :y_split lets us refer to this rule later, for example in
# rule_ordering = [:x_split, :y_split].
add_disjunction!(
    dm,
    [LinearConstraint([0.0, 1.0], :<=, 0.25)],
    [LinearConstraint([0.0, 1.0], :>=, 0.75)];
    name = :y_split,
)
```

Inspect the user-facing model:

```julia
print_model(dm)
```

Inspect the lifted projection formulations:

```julia
print_projection_model(dm; formulation = :dnf)

print_projection_model(dm; formulation = :cnf)

print_projection_model(
    dm;
    formulation = :partial_dnf,
    num_dnf_rules = 1,
    rule_ordering = [:x_split, :y_split],
)
```

---

## Optional: JuMP-style linear constraints

For convenience, users can also write constraints using JuMP’s `@build_constraint` syntax. This avoids manually constructing `LinearConstraint` objects.

```julia
using JuMP
using DisjunctiveDifferentiableLayers

# Create a fresh model.
dm2 = DisjunctiveModel(2)

set_bounds!(
    dm2,
    lower = [0.0, 0.0],
    upper = [1.0, 1.0],
)

# Get the JuMP variables associated with the model outputs.
y = output_variables(dm2)

# Add the global constraint:
# y[1] + y[2] >= 0.8
add_linear_constraint!(
    dm2,
    @build_constraint(y[1] + y[2] >= 0.8),
)

# Add rule 1:
# y[1] <= 0.25 OR y[1] >= 0.75
add_disjunction!(
    dm2,
    [@build_constraint(y[1] <= 0.25)],
    [@build_constraint(y[1] >= 0.75)];
    name = :x_split,
)

# Add rule 2:
# y[2] <= 0.25 OR y[2] >= 0.75
add_disjunction!(
    dm2,
    [@build_constraint(y[2] <= 0.25)],
    [@build_constraint(y[2] >= 0.75)];
    name = :y_split,
)
```

The explicit `LinearConstraint(...)` interface and the JuMP-style `@build_constraint(...)` interface create the same internal representation.

---

## Core API

### `DisjunctiveModel(n_outputs)`

Creates a model for a neural network output vector of length `n_outputs`.

```julia
dm = DisjunctiveModel(3)
```

This means the projection layer expects raw neural network predictions of length 3:

```julia
yhat = [yhat1, yhat2, yhat3]
```

and returns a projected vector:

```julia
y = [y1, y2, y3]
```

---

### `set_bounds!(model; lower, upper)`

Sets box bounds on the projected output variables.

```julia
set_bounds!(
    dm,
    lower = [0.0, 0.0],
    upper = [1.0, 1.0],
)
```

This imposes:

```text
0 <= y[1] <= 1
0 <= y[2] <= 1
```

Finite bounds are strongly recommended because they are used by the convex-hull formulations.

---

### `LinearConstraint(a, sense, b)`

Represents a linear constraint of the form:

```text
a' y <= b
a' y >= b
a' y == b
```

depending on `sense`.

Examples:

```julia
LinearConstraint([1.0, 1.0], :>=, 0.8)
```

means:

```text
y[1] + y[2] >= 0.8
```

```julia
LinearConstraint([1.0, 0.0], :<=, 0.25)
```

means:

```text
y[1] <= 0.25
```

Supported senses are:

```julia
:<=
:>=
:(==)
```

---

### `add_linear_constraint!(model, ...)`

Adds a global linear constraint.

Global constraints are enforced across the full projection model. They are useful for constraints that should always hold, regardless of which disjunctive branch is active.

Coefficient-vector form:

```julia
add_linear_constraint!(
    dm,
    [1.0, 1.0],
    :>=,
    0.8,
)
```

Equivalent explicit object form:

```julia
add_linear_constraint!(
    dm,
    LinearConstraint([1.0, 1.0], :>=, 0.8),
)
```

Equivalent JuMP-style form:

```julia
using JuMP

y = output_variables(dm)

add_linear_constraint!(
    dm,
    @build_constraint(y[1] + y[2] >= 0.8),
)
```

---

### `add_disjunction!(model, disjuncts...; name = nothing)`

Adds a disjunctive rule.

Each argument is one disjunct, and each disjunct is a vector of linear constraints.

For example:

```julia
add_disjunction!(
    dm,
    [LinearConstraint([1.0, 0.0], :<=, 0.25)],
    [LinearConstraint([1.0, 0.0], :>=, 0.75)];
    name = :x_split,
)
```

means:

```text
y[1] <= 0.25 OR y[1] >= 0.75
```

A disjunct can contain multiple constraints:

```julia
add_disjunction!(
    dm,
    [
        LinearConstraint([1.0, 0.0], :>=, 0.4),
        LinearConstraint([1.0, 0.0], :<=, 0.6),
    ],
    [LinearConstraint([1.0, 0.0], :>=, 0.8)];
    name = :x_mid_or_high,
)
```

means:

```text
0.4 <= y[1] <= 0.6 OR y[1] >= 0.8
```

The same rule can be written with JuMP-style constraints:

```julia
using JuMP

y = output_variables(dm)

add_disjunction!(
    dm,
    [
        @build_constraint(y[1] >= 0.4),
        @build_constraint(y[1] <= 0.6),
    ],
    [@build_constraint(y[1] >= 0.8)];
    name = :x_mid_or_high,
)
```

The `name` keyword is optional, but recommended. Named rules can be used to control partial-DNF ordering:

```julia
rule_ordering = [:x_split, :y_split]
```

---

### `output_variables(model)`

Returns JuMP variables associated with the output coordinates. This is used with JuMP-style constraint construction.

```julia
using JuMP

y = output_variables(dm)

add_linear_constraint!(
    dm,
    @build_constraint(y[1] + y[2] >= 0.8),
)
```

This is often easier to read than manually writing coefficient vectors.

---

### `project(model, yhat; formulation = :dnf)`

Projects a raw prediction onto the selected convexified rule set.

```julia
yhat = [0.5, 0.1]

result = project(dm, yhat; formulation = :dnf)

println(result.status)
println(result.y)
```

The result contains:

```julia
result.y       # projected prediction
result.status  # solver termination status
result.model   # internal JuMP/DiffOpt model
```

Common choices:

```julia
project(dm, yhat; formulation = :dnf)

project(dm, yhat; formulation = :cnf)

project(
    dm,
    yhat;
    formulation = :partial_dnf,
    num_dnf_rules = 1,
    rule_ordering = [:x_split, :y_split],
)
```

---

### `DisjunctiveProjectionLayer(model; formulation = :dnf)`

Creates a differentiable projection layer.

```julia
layer = DisjunctiveProjectionLayer(dm; formulation = :partial_dnf)

y = layer(yhat)
```

The layer can be placed after a Flux neural network.

```julia
model = Chain(
    Dense(4 => 16, relu),
    Dense(16 => 2),
    layer,
)
```

---

### `constrained_model(backbone, model; kwargs...)`

Wraps a Flux neural network with a disjunctive projection layer.

```julia
model = constrained_model(
    backbone,
    dm;
    formulation = :partial_dnf,
    num_dnf_rules = 1,
    rule_ordering = [:x_rule, :y_rule],
)
```

Calling the model evaluates:

```julia
yhat = backbone(x)
y = projection_layer(yhat)
```

Only the neural network backbone has trainable parameters. The projection layer is differentiable but has no trainable weights.

---

### `constrained_model(backbone, example_input) do dm ... end`

Creates a `DisjunctiveModel` automatically by inferring the output dimension from the neural network.

```julia
model = constrained_model(backbone, x0; formulation = :cnf) do dm
    set_bounds!(dm, lower = zeros(2), upper = ones(2))
    add_linear_constraint!(dm, [1.0, 1.0], :>=, 0.8)
end
```

This is the most convenient API for Flux users.

---

## Projection API

Project a raw prediction:

```julia
yhat = [0.5, 0.1]

result = project(dm, yhat; formulation = :dnf)

println(result.status)
println(result.y)
```

Use a projection layer directly:

```julia
layer = DisjunctiveProjectionLayer(dm; formulation = :dnf)

y = layer(yhat)
```

Available formulations:

```julia
layer_dnf = DisjunctiveProjectionLayer(dm; formulation = :dnf)

layer_cnf = DisjunctiveProjectionLayer(dm; formulation = :cnf)

layer_partial = DisjunctiveProjectionLayer(
    dm;
    formulation = :partial_dnf,
    num_dnf_rules = 1,
    rule_ordering = [:x_split, :y_split],
)
```

## Full Flux example

The following example builds a small neural network, defines a disjunctive rule set, compares `:dnf`, `:cnf`, and `:partial_dnf` projections on the same raw neural network output, runs one training step, and performs inference on a single sample.

The same script is available under [`examples/flux_end2end.jl`](examples/flux_end2end.jl).

## Formulation summaries and benchmarking

The package includes utilities for inspecting lifted formulations:

```julia
formulation_summary(dm; formulation = :dnf)

formulation_summary(dm; formulation = :cnf)

formulation_summary(
    dm;
    formulation = :partial_dnf,
    num_dnf_rules = 1,
    rule_ordering = [:x_split, :y_split],
)
```

Benchmark projection time and model size:

```julia
benchmark_projection(dm, yhat; formulation = :cnf, label = "CNF")

benchmark_projection(
    dm,
    yhat;
    formulation = :partial_dnf,
    num_dnf_rules = 1,
    rule_ordering = [:x_split, :y_split],
    label = "partial-DNF k=1",
)
```

Example output:

```text
CNF                  status=OPTIMAL build=0.002s solve=0.003s vars=54 cons=152 y=[0.5, 0.2]
partial-DNF k=1      status=OPTIMAL build=0.003s solve=0.004s vars=62 cons=180 y=[0.5, 0.2]
```

## Current limitations

- Constraints are currently linear.
- The differentiable backend relies on DiffOpt.
- A modified DiffOpt with regularized KKT solves is recommended for robust reverse differentiation.
- Full DNF can grow exponentially in the number of disjunctions.
- Partial-DNF is intended to trade off formulation strength and computational size.
- The package currently targets Flux.jl as the main neural network interface.
